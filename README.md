## Google Play Store Apps Data Analysis 
https://github.com/mohayo8/DSA3050_Power_Bi_Assignment-Mohamed-006/tree/main/Quiz

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, transforming, and modeling data from the Google Play Store to enable effective analysis. The dataset contains details of applications and user reviews, which were processed to fix data quality issues and establish a relational data model. The transformations and modeling were performed using Power Query and Power BI.

## Dataset
* **Source**: The data is sourced from Kaggle, titled "Google Play Store Apps" (Feb 2019) by L. Gupta.
* **Files**: The analysis utilizes the `googleplaystore.csv` and `googleplaystore_user_reviews.csv` files.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
Several data quality issues were addressed using Power Query to prepare the data for analysis:
* **Headers**: Fixed the `googleplaystore_user_reviews` table by renaming columns and removing the first row, as the column names were initially being counted as a data row.
* **Missing Values**: Removed missing or `(blank)` values from the `Translated_Review` column. Additionally, filtered out useless `nan` values from both the user reviews table and the `Rating` column in the main app table.
* **Data Type Conversions**:
    * Changed the `Last Updated` column from text to a date format.
    * Changed the `Reviews` column from text to a whole number, as review counts cannot contain words.
    * Changed the `Rating` column from text to a decimal number.
* **Currency Parsing**: Used the English (United States) locale setting to successfully parse the `$` sign in the `Price` column, converting it from a text type to a numeric value.
* **Text Extraction**: Trimmed, cleaned, capitalized, and split the "Android Ver" column to create two new columns: `Min Android Ver` and `Max Android Ver`.

## Feature Engineering
New columns and tables were generated to aid in analysis and categorization:
* **Rating Category**: A conditional column was added to classify app ratings as "High" (greater than 4), "Medium" (greater than 2.5), or "Low" (otherwise).
* **Price With Tax**: A custom column was calculated using the formula `=[Price]*1.08`.
* **Category Stats Table**: A duplicated table was created and grouped by `Category` to output `Total Apps` (using the Count Rows operation) and `Average Rating` (using the Average operation).

## Data Modeling
The project utilizes a relational data model with the following architecture:
* **Dimension Table**: The `googleplaystore` table acts as the dimension table because it contains descriptive attributes about the apps and serves as a lookup table.
* **Fact Table**: The `googleplaystore_user_reviews` table serves as the fact table because it records frequent events, specifically the individual reviews submitted by users.
* **Relationship**: A 1-to-Many relationship is established between the `googleplaystore` and `googleplaystore_user_reviews` tables using the `App` column.
* **Key Uniqueness**: To resolve a many-to-many cardinality warning and prevent filter ambiguity that inflates totals, the `App` column in the dimension table was trimmed, converted to lowercase, and stripped of duplicates to ensure a strictly unique primary key.
* **Date Table**: A dedicated calendar table (containing Date, Year, and Month Name) is necessary to utilize built-in Time Intelligence DAX functions (like Year-to-Date) and to act as a central filter for slicing continuous dates.

## Data Dictionary
Key columns utilized within the model include:

| Table | Column | Meaning | Type | Key/Attribute |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **googleplaystore** | `App` | Unique name of the application | Text | Primary Key |
| **googleplaystore** | `Price` | Cost of the app (after locale conversion) | Currency | Attribute |
| **googleplaystore** | `Rating Category` | Custom conditional grouping (High/Medium/Low) | Text | Attribute |
| **googleplaystore** | `Min Android Version` | Minimum OS required (from split column step) | Text | Attribute |
| **googleplaystore** | `Last Updated` | The date the application was last updated | Date | Attribute |
| **googleplaystore_user_reviews** | `App` | Name of the app being reviewed | Text | Foreign Key |
| **googleplaystore_user_reviews** | `Translated_Review` | The user's written feedback in English | Text | Attribute |
| **googleplaystore_user_reviews** | `Sentiment` | The emotional tone of the review (Positive/Negative) | Text | Attribute |

## Amazon E-commerce Sales Analysis - End-to-End Power BI Project

## Project Overview
This project serves as a comprehensive Business Intelligence solution, transforming raw e-commerce data into an interactive, executive-level dashboard. The goal was to demonstrate the complete data analytics lifecycle: sourcing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations via Power Query, relational data modeling, and visualization.

## 1. Data Sourcing
[cite_start]The foundational dataset was obtained from Kaggle, specifically the "AmazonSalesReport" by Arpit Mishra[cite: 1]. [cite_start]This dataset was selected because it provides comprehensive, real-world transactional data detailing order statuses, product categories, pricing, and fulfillment methods over time[cite: 1]. 

## 2. Data Preparation & Transformation (ETL)
Raw data rarely arrives ready for analysis. Using Power Query, the dataset underwent extensive cleaning and transformation to ensure accuracy and usability:
* [cite_start]**Establishing Structure:** Promoted the first row to act as headers and explicitly defined the data types for each column to ensure calculations functioned correctly[cite: 2]. [cite_start]Completely empty columns were permanently removed[cite: 3].
* **Handling Null Values:** Addressed missing data systematically to maintain data integrity. [cite_start]Null values in the `Amount` column were replaced with `0`, as these instances correlated directly to canceled orders[cite: 4]. [cite_start]Nulls in the `fulfilled-by` column were replaced with "Amazon"[cite: 5].
* **Standardizing Text:** Inconsistent data entries can ruin dashboard grouping. [cite_start]To fix this, the `ship-city` column was formatted to capitalize each word[cite: 6].
* [cite_start]**Feature Engineering:** To enable robust time-series analysis, new columns for `Year` and `Month Name` were extracted from the main date field[cite: 7]. [cite_start]Additionally, a conditional column named `Order_Value_Tier` was created to categorize orders greater than 1000 as "High Value"[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]The main query was professionally renamed to `Facts_AmazonSales`[cite: 9].

## 3. Relational Data Modeling (Star Schema)
To optimize the dashboard's performance and cross-filtering capabilities, the flat dataset was normalized into a Star Schema structure. 



* **Building Dimension Tables:** The main fact table was referenced to create separate dimension tables. [cite_start]`Dim_Product` isolated the `Category` and `Size` attributes [cite: 10][cite_start], while `Dim_Location` isolated `ship-city`, `ship-state`, `ship-postal-code`, and `ship-country`[cite: 12]. [cite_start]Duplicates were removed from both tables, and Index columns were added to serve as unique Primary Keys[cite: 11, 13].
**Optimizing the Fact Table:** The new dimension tables were merged back into the `Facts_AmazonSales` table to bring over the respective `Location_ID` and `Product_ID`.The heavy, redundant text columns were then deleted from the fact table, vastly improving query speed.
**Establishing Relationships:** Within the Model view, active relationships were established[cite: 17, 18]. [cite_start]The dimension tables were connected to the fact table using a Many-to-one (*:1) cardinality and a Single cross-filter direction[cite: 19, 20].

## 4. Dashboard Development & Insights
The final step involved building an interactive dashboard focused on actionable business insights:
**High-Level KPIs:** Top-level cards immediately inform stakeholders of Total Sales (78.59M), Total Orders (120.229K), and the Average Order Value (609.34)[cite: 21].
**Trend & Distribution:** A line chart maps the monthly sales trajectory, while a donut chart provides a clear breakdown of order fulfillment statuses (e.g., Shipped vs. Cancelled)[cite: 21].
**Geospatial & Category Tracking:** A map visual highlights geographical sales distributions, and a clustered bar chart ranks revenue across different product categories like T-shirts and Shirts[cite: 21].
**Interactivity:** Slicers for `B2B` (True/False) and `Month Name` allow users to dynamically filter the entire page to isolate specific trends[cite: 21].

## 5. Live Deployment
The finalized report was published from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI Service for web accessibility.
